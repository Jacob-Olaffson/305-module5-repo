# 305-module5-repo

Repository for the assignment of CS305 module 5 yup thats what it is.

Oh yeah I'm supposed to put info about a project I'm working on. well for CS386 my group and I made a web app for automated customizable news that sends news you want to see straight to your email. [take a look](https://github.com/TheFellaz/Newstr-News).
The license we used on that project was the GPL 3.0 which is a doozy and I'm not gonna copy it all here.
